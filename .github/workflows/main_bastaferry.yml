 are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Ensure the  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read #This is required for actions/ virtual environment is created:**
   Make sure thatcheckout

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@ the virtual environment is being created before itv4

      - name: Set up Python version
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version is used. You can add a step to create the virtual environment: '3.9'

      - name: Create and start virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.

2. **Check the path to the virtual environment:**
   Verify the path to the Python executable in the virtual environment
        run: |
          python -m venv venv
          if [ -d "venv/bin" ]; then
            source venv/bin/activate
          else
            echo. The path might be different depending on how the environment "Virtual environment directory not found!"
            exit is set up.
